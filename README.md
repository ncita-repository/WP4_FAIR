# WP4_FAIR

### NCITA Repository Unit Work Package 4: Developments to implement FAIR principles within XNAT

The aim of WP 4 (yet to start) is to develop additions to XNAT to make data more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable, in accordance with the general principles set out by [Wilkinson et al (2016)](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618.pdf?origin=ppub).

The NCITA Repository Unit site as a whole is at an early stage of the life cycle and does not currently have a formal structure of documentation releases. Please bear with us: things will become more organised as the NCITA project gets into gear! Note that the ICR also releases code related to the XNAT-OHIF image viewer at https://bitbucket.org/icrimaginginformatics/.
